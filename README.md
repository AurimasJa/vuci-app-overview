# Vuci overview application
This application is created for my personal learning.
The project involves creating a Vuci application that focuses upon router overview information including draggable cards.
## Uci configuration
Using uci configuration (overview) manipulating data.
```
config card
  option position 0
  option isVisible true
  option title 'title'
```
It will be determined how cards will be displayed based on position.
## Vuci overview
Show all available network, system, and log information. Cards must be draggable, and positions must be changed. There is a drawer in which we can hide cards.
